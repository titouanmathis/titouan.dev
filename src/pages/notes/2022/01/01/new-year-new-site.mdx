# New year, new site

<div class="tracking-wide uppercase opacity-70">

</div>

I last updated my website 5 years ago, it was time to freshen it up a bit. I discovered [Iles](https://github.com/ElMassimo/iles) not so long ago and wanted to give it a go for 2 main reasons:

- Use a minimal amount of JavaScript
- Test Vue 3 and its composition API

Both Iles and the composition API are fun to use, I'd recommend them!
