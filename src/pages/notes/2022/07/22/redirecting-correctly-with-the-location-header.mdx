# Redirecting with the `Location` header

I was stuck with a redirection not happening in a Nuxt middleware on a recent project:

```js
export default defineNuxtRouteMiddleware((from, to) => {
  const { isLoggedIn } = useAuth();

  if (!isLoggedIn()) {
    return navigateTo('/login', {
      redirectCode: 401,
    });
  }
});
```

When trying to access a page without being logged in, instead of being redirected, the browser was displaying a message "Redirecting to /login". It turns out that using the `401` (unauthorized)status code was blocking the redirection specified in the response `Location` header. [The documentation on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/web/http/headers/location) is quite clear on the subject:

> The `Location` response header indicates the URL to redirect a page to. It only provides a meaning when served with a `3xx` (redirection) or `201` (created) status response.

Changing the `redirectCode` value from `401` to `302` (found) fixed the issue:

```diff
  export default defineNuxtRouteMiddleware((from, to) => {
    const { isLoggedIn } = useAuth();

    if (!isLoggedIn()) {
      return navigateTo('/login', {
-       redirectCode: 401,
+       redirectCode: 302,
      });
    }
  });
```

Although, I am not sure if this is the correct status code for an authentication middleware.
